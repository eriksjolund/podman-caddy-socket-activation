### Examples that are under development

> [!WARNING]
> These examples are currently experiments that might not even work at all.
> Instead of using long-lived work-in-progress draft PRs for
> these experiments it is easier to look at the half-baked code by having the files
> directly in the git main branch.
> When an example looks good enough, it will be moved to the directory [../examples](../examples)
